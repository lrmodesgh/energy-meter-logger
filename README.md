# Energy Meter Logger
    $ git clone https://github.com/samuelphy/energy-meter-logger

 I have just redone and reused the awesome project demonstrated by samuelphy energy meter logger from the above git link.

all i have done is read the python code, yml configuration and changed it to fit my local needs.

EM09.yml actually is created to suit the energy meter modbus/rs485 register information provided by the MECO manufacturer of
EM09 instrument.

Many thanks to SamuelPhy
